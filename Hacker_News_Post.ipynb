Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",

    "##### - id: the unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "##### - title: the title of the post\n",
    "##### - url: the URL that the posts links to, if the post has a URL\n",
    "##### - num_points: the number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "##### - num_comments: the number of comments on the post\n",
    "##### - author: the username of the person who submitted the post\n",

    "#### In this project, we analyzed ask posts and show posts to determine which type of post and time receive the most comments on average. Based on our analysis, to maximize the amount of comments a post receives, we'd recommend the post be categorized as ask post and created between 15:00 and 16:00 (3:00 pm est - 4:00 pm est).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### However, it should be noted that the data set we analyzed excluded posts without any comments. Given that, it's more accurate to say that of the posts that received comments, ask posts received more comments on average and ask posts created between 15:00 and 16:00 (3:00 pm est - 4:00 pm est) received the most comments on average."
